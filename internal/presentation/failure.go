/*
Why making a deck failed, in terms of what to do about it.

Every one of these used to reach a person as the Go error that produced it:

	ptium is unreachable: Post "http://ptium.internal:8080/api/v1/presentations": dial tcp: connection refused
	ptium status 401: api key is invalid or expired
	ptium returned ...: json: cannot unmarshal array into Go value of type presentation.deckEnvelope

Each says what happened and none says what to do, and two of them say things a
person who just wanted slides should not be shown at all: the address of an
internal service, and the name of a Go type.

The distinction that matters to the reader is not the status code. It is who
can fix it. A wrong API key is the administrator's; a layout the template lacks
is the author's, and Ptium already said which slide; a service that is down is
nobody's until it comes back. So the kinds below are cut that way.

// whoever has to do something about it.

	FailureUnreachable FailureKind = "unreachable"

	// FailureNoAPI: something answered but it is not the Ptium API — usually the
	// address points at a web page, a proxy, or the wrong path.
	FailureNoAPI FailureKind = "no-api"
	// FailureRejected: Ptium understood the request and would not do it. This is
	// the one where Ptium's own words are worth repeating verbatim, because they
	// name the slide and the reason.
	FailureRejected FailureKind = "rejected"
	// FailureRemote: Ptium broke on its own side.
	FailureRemote FailureKind = "remote-error"
	// FailureUnexpected: Ptium answered something this version cannot read.
	FailureUnexpected FailureKind = "unexpected-response"
	// FailureNotRecorded: the deck exists in Ptium and umm failed to write it
	// down. The two are now out of step, which is why it is not folded into the
	// others — the deck is really there and retrying makes a second one.
