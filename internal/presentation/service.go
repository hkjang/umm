/*
Turning a space into a deck, end to end.

Preview compiles and shows; Create makes the deck. Someone looking at what
their space would become must not thereby change anything — not their space,
not Ptium — so the preview paths never write a link, never create a deck, and
pass dryRun down when they do reach Ptium at all.

The dependencies are interfaces rather than the concrete store and client so
that the orchestration — the order of the calls, what happens when one fails,
what gets recorded either way — can be tested without a database or a live
Ptium. The parts that genuinely need those have their own tests elsewhere.
