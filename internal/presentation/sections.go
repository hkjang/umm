/*
Dividing a long talk into parts.

A deck of two hundred slides is a flat run with no shape. Sections give it one:
where a part begins, and what that part is about.

This adds slides and moves none.

That distinction is the whole design. The order a deck is in is not umm's guess
— it is a `follows` chain, which is somebody stating a sequence outright, and
failing that the order they laid the canvas out in, which is also something they
did. Having a model reorder that would override what the person said, which is
the same line the headings work refused to cross for a different reason. Asking
where the parts begin is a reading of the order they chose; rearranging it is a
disagreement with it.

So a section is a heading over slides that were already next to each other. It
carries none of the person's words — it is a new slide with a title and nothing
else — and every original slide keeps its place, its content and the thoughts it
came from. Slide positions shift by the number of sections inserted before them,
and the source map is built from the same list afterwards, so a slide can still
say which thoughts it quotes.
