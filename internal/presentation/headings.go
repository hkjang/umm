/*
Naming the huddles.

A slide built from thoughts the person connected already says what it is: their
claim heads it, their evidence sits under it. A slide built from thoughts that
merely sit together has no such heading, so it borrows the first thought's — and
the first thought is not the topic, it is just whichever one is nearest the top
left.

That is the one heading in the deck worth improving, and it is a label rather
than content. So this is the only place a model is asked anything, and it is
asked for a name, never for a sentence that goes on a slide.

The line this does not cross: the words on the slides stay the person's. A deck
compiled from someone's thinking is worth giving because they can stand behind
every line of it, and they cannot stand behind a paraphrase they have not read.
Naming a group they made is help; rewriting what they wrote is replacement.

Everything here is optional in the strongest sense. No chat model, a model that
fails, a model that answers something unusable — all of them leave the deck
exactly as it compiled, with the headings umm derived itself. Polish that breaks
must not break the thing it was polishing.
