// What a band change would do to the thoughts already here.
//
// The two bands decide how much of the graph a person sees: how many thoughts a
// card calls related, and how the canvas groups them once it is too far out to
// read. They are standard deviations above the mean of a space's own scores, so
// what a given number does depends entirely on the corpus — which meant the
// administrator screen offered two spin buttons whose effect could only be
// learned by saving them and going to look.
//
// Saving them and going to look is the wrong order. Everyone's canvas changes
// at once, and the person who changed it finds out last.
//
// So this measures both settings against the notes the installation actually
// holds, before anything is written: the current bands and the proposed ones,
// on the same sample, in one pass.

// BandOutcome is what one pair of bands does to the sampled notes.
